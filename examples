examples/ Directory:

This directory provides users with ready-to-use examples that can be easily implemented in their project. It helps them to customize and optimize their visualizer without needing to start from scratch.

color_palettes/ Directory:

Purpose: This directory contains pre-defined color palettes that users can apply to their LED matrix visualization.
Content:
Each color palette can be represented in various formats, such as:
Code snippets: Arduino/ESP32 code that defines the color palette as an array of RGB values.
Configuration files: Text files or JSON files that store the color palette data.
Image files: Visual representations of the color palettes.
Examples of color palettes:
Rainbow: A palette that cycles through the colors of the rainbow.
Fire: A palette with warm colors like red, orange, and yellow.
Ocean: A palette with cool colors like blue and green.
Monochrome: A palette that uses shades of a single color.
User defined: an example of how to make a user defined pallete.
Implementation:
Users can copy the code snippets or configuration files into their AudioSpectrumVisualizer.ino file or load them from external files.
Example of a rainbow palette in code:
C++

// Example: Rainbow color palette
uint32_t rainbowPalette[] = {
  0xFF0000, // Red
  0xFF7F00, // Orange
  0xFFFF00, // Yellow
  0x00FF00, // Green
  0x0000FF, // Blue
  0x4B0082, // Indigo
  0x8B00FF  // Violet
};
sensitivity_settings/ Directory:

Purpose: This directory contains example sensitivity settings that users can apply to their microphone input and visualization scaling.
Content:
Each sensitivity setting can be represented as:
Code snippets: Arduino/ESP32 code that defines the sensitivity values (e.g., microphone gain, scaling factors).
Configuration files: Text files or JSON files that store the sensitivity settings.
Examples of sensitivity settings:
Low sensitivity: Suitable for loud environments or strong audio signals.
Medium sensitivity: A balanced setting for typical audio levels.
High sensitivity: Suitable for quiet environments or weak audio signals.
Specific genre settings: settings optimized for voice, music, or other audio types.
Example of sensitivity settings in code:
C++

// Example: Medium sensitivity settings
#define MICROPHONE_GAIN 1.0 // Adjust microphone gain
#define AMPLITUDE_SCALE 2.0 // Adjust amplitude scaling
Implementation:
Users can copy the code snippets or configuration files into their AudioSpectrumVisualizer.ino file or load them from external files.
Users can then adjust the values to fine-tune the sensitivity to their specific needs.
Purpose of sensitivity settings:
To allow the visualizer to adapt to different audio input levels.
To prevent clipping or distortion of the audio signal.
To optimize the dynamic range of the visualization.
